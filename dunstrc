    ### Display ###

    monitor = 0

    # Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
    #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
    #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
    #   none: don't follow anything
    #
    # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
    # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.

    # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
    # will be ignored.

    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken

    #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.

    # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as

    # is connected or disconnected which might break follow mode if the screen
    # layout changes.

    #              such action, open the context menu.
    # * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple
    #             ones, open the context menu.
    # * close_current: Close current notification.
    # * close_all: Close all notifications.
    # * context: Open context menu for the notification.
