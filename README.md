- Just saving for my custom linux: emacs, vim, tmux, bash. 
- Also copied some (many) ref from my idol, [rexim/dotfiles](https://github.com/rexim/dotfiles). Give him 1 sub on twitch  [tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding) or youtube [tsoding-daily](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily/featured), you will find many thing to learn on him! 
- Delete stupid white space and refresh package each time start emacs. Maybe Rexim dont think thats hard to use, but I do.
- I unbinded all his spec key, also adding some my custom variable (color, layout, styles, some function...) :> 

## Deploy
